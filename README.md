# Hello and Welcome

## :information_desk_person:  About Me  :information_desk_person:

I'm Neil. I am a developer and technical writer in the U.K.  

I am currently learning about Excel, Python, SQL, data visualisation and cloud with an aim to become either a data analyst or data engineer.

I also develop backend API's with Python, Django and SQL databases such as PostgreSQL.

Lastly, I also enjoy writing about what I am learning about on my blog.
